#### Rules (from the website)
- Take Over an NFT to change the Punchline.
- You score 1 point every second you hold the NFT.
- The TT you pay to Take Over goes into a Prize Pool
- When the round ends we distribute the Prize Pool to the winners. We then reset the scores and start the next round.
- Prize Pool is distributed amongst the best players ...

### ThunderCore Game Monitoring
The main goal is to monitor user spending on this game.

1. Users will have to register themselves with ThunderCore Hub or MetaMask on the website, using their wallets address.
2. In "no cost" mode, the user can see their own expenses with the game in a round.
3. In paid mode the user can see the expenses of other players. A price will be stipulated in TT tokens. The user pays and chooses an address to monitor. For each additional address the cost increases, or the price increases according to the placement, first placement pays 100 TT, 2nd place pays 90 TT, up to 10th place which will pay 10TT.
4. The payment entitles the user to monitor addresses for a round, for another round it will reset and must pay again.

### P.S.
For this project to be possible, I must be able to monitor transactions with the Dapp contract through the viewblock.io or ThunderCore Scan tool.
